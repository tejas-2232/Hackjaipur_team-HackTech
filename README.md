## Project submission for HackJaipur Hackathon.
__Title:__ Video and text chatting web application <br>
__App Name:__ videoXT  <br>
__The problem it solves:__ <p> The problem focuses on two tracks. First track is diversity,  i.e anyone can use this application to do<br>
              video chatting in their day to day life.It doesnt descriminate users based on age,gender,color or anything society finds descriminating.
              We belive in __*Unity in Diversity.*__  
              Second trackc is Remote working.As work from home is becoming is a widespread culture, technology
can make the process easier. This app is best to use for peoples who are working from their home. Also it can be used in one-to-one chatting between __doctor-patient__ or __Teacher-student__,
or any local __shopkeeper-customer.__ Using the app is very simple. Just open the URL & you are good to go.</p>

__Challenges I ran into:__ <p>First challenge was to how to create this video calling with multiple users.<br>
So  we first made server-client chatting framework and upon testing we moved to video part.<br>
Being beginner in node and express we face many challenges while building it. Like different dependiencies and packages.<br>
Connecting peer to peer was major problem. We were not getting the right tool to connect to clients with different browsers.<br>
So we used  PeerJS which solved our problem

*we are still improving and making  the app better.* </p>

__Technologies I used:__ HTML,javascript,NodeJS, Express(Web framework for Node.js, websocket,socket.io,PeerJS,Real time communication.
